## üìÑ MazaoCredit Documentation Repository (Docs Repo)

The **MazaoCredit Docs Repository** serves as the central knowledge base for all aspects of the platform, from high-level business strategy and human-centered design (HCD) to the low-level code architecture and deployment pipelines. It ensures that the project remains **transparent, scalable, and reproducible**.

The repository is structured to support four main user groups: **Business/Strategy Leads**, **UX/Designers**, **AI/Data Experts**, and **Agri/Domain Specialists**.

### **Core Sections**

#### 1. üí° Concept & Strategy Documentation (For Business & Domain Leads)

This section provides the *Why* and *What* of the project, documenting the problem context and alignment with the hackathon's core themes: Agri-Finance, Parametric Insurance, and AI-Powered Credit Scoring.

* **Problem Context & User Stories:** Detailed analysis of systemic exclusion smallholder farmers face from credit markets, including lack of formal financial histories and reliance on limited data.
* **Concept Narrative:** The overarching problem, the chosen AI method, and the expected impact on farmer resilience.
* **Business Model & Scalability Plan:** Documentation on how the solution ensures it can be adapted to real agri-finance systems.
* **Deliverables:** The final *Technical Narrative* (method, assumptions, scalability) and the *Pitch Deck* are hosted here.

#### 2. ‚ú® Human-Centered Design (HCD) & UX/UI Documentation (For UX/Designers)

Focuses on the dual-channel approach and 2G inclusivity.

* **Platform Flow Diagrams:** Mapping of the user journey for both the **Web App** (Voice/Photo Input) and the **2G Inclusive Core** (SMS/USSD/Hotline input) channels.
* **Accessibility & Inclusion Protocols:** Guidelines and wireframes for ultra-lean prompts to ensure the platform is accessible to all small-scale farmers regardless of device or connectivity.
* **Visualization Specs:** Requirements for the simple dashboard showing risk and repayment outcomes.

#### 3. üß† AI & Data Governance Documentation (For AI/Data Experts)

Covers the technical implementation of the two development tracks.

* **Model Architecture (Track 1):**
    * **Feature Engineering Log:** Documentation of identified variables (e.g., farm size, yields, cooperative activity).
    * **Modeling Approaches:** Documentation of models tested (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) and the chosen algorithm.
    * **Transparency & Explainable AI (XAI):** Documentation of all assumptions, parameters, and the use of SHAP/LIME to explain results.
    * **Evaluation Metrics:** Defined use of metrics like ROC-AUC, F1-score, precision, and recall.
* **Risk & Loan Simulation Engine (Track 2):** Documentation of the Loan recommendation logic, dynamic risk update rules, and **What-if Testing** scenarios.
* **Bias Mitigation Log:** Records of fairness checks and strategies employed to avoid bias across gender, region, or farm size.
* **Data Dictionary & Source Mapping:** Comprehensive guide to the data repository, defining all features, sources, and data lineage.

#### 4. üõ†Ô∏è Code & Technical Infrastructure Docs

The *how* of deployment and maintenance.

* **Reproducibility Guide:** Instructions on how to run the reproducible ML pipeline (Python, R, or Colab) and the Loan Simulation Logic code.
* **API Specifications:** Details on integrated APIs, including the Weather/Satellite Data API for parametric insurance and the M-Pesa integration for payments and transaction history.
* **Deployment Architecture:** Diagrams for the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for the production model.
* **Open-Source Alignment:** Documentation ensuring the code is clear, commented, and reproducible.
